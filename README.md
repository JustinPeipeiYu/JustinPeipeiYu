## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on SLSM, a financial tracker, and PTE, a rule-based translator
- 🏃 Before I became highly addicted to smoking, I was a runner. I won 2nd place at my 8th grade city track meet!
- 😄 Secret: I've have crushes on about 4 different people every year since the age of 6
- ⚡ Fun fact: My family moved around a lot when I was a child so I lived in 5 cities before the age of 9 - Guangshan, Guangzhou, Toronto, Belleville, and Guelph
