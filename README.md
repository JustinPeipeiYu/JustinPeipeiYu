## Hi there 👋

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on SLSM, a financial tracker, and PTE, a rule-based translator
- 🏃 Before I became highly addicted to smoking, I was a runner. I won 2nd place at my eighth grade city track meet!
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: My family moved around a lot as a child so I lived in 5 cities before the age of 9 - Guangshan, Guangzhou, Toronto, Belleville, and Guelph
